# React-todo
todo app using Reactjs


It is a Reactjs ToDo app.

it might create issues deleting items because i used index as keys which change evrytime we ammend a change in the list.

i know it was lame to use index as keys lol... but wasnt wanting to generate keys and then change the would data structure of the app.
